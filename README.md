# health_machine_learning_project
The present project of Machine Learning deals with a health study case to propose a solution to the problem following the
methodology of analysis and resolution of problems.

The steps and questions to answer for problem resolution were:
1) Describe initial hypotheses regarding the problem before looking at the data
2) Comment on the results obtained from the exploratory data analysis
3) Comment, if applicable, about the data cleansing processes executed
4) List and briefly describe, if applicable, the new variables created for the model
5) What is the metric that you consider most adequate to evaluate the performance of this
model? (Accuracy, Precision, Sensitivity, Specificity)
6) Describe the best model and expected results

Study case:

Cardiovascular diseases are one of the leading causes of death in the world.
In 2019, an estimated 17.9 million people died from a disease
cardiovascular, representing 32% of deaths, that year globally.
Of these deaths, 85% belong to heart attacks and strokes, and a
One third of these deaths occurred prematurely in people under 70 years of age. The
Heart failures are a common event caused by cardiovascular diseases.
and the given dataset contains 11 variables that can help predict its occurrence.

People with cardiovascular disease or at high cardiovascular risk (for presence of one or more risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia or other established diseases) need early detection and management in which a model of Machine Learning can be of great help.

Variables for cardiovascular disease early detection are:
1) Patient Age
2) Chest Pain Type: classified in TA: typical angina, ATA: atypical angina, NAP: Unstable angina pectoris and ASY: asyntomatic
3) RestingBP: blood pressure status when resting (in mm Hg)
4) Cholesterol level (in mm/dl)
5) RestingECG: results from electrocardiogram when resting classified in Normal, ST: annomalies in the ST-T wave (inversion of the T wave and/or elevation or ST depression > 0.05 mV), LVH: Left ventricular hypertrophy probable or definite according to the Estes criteria.
6) MaxHR: maximum heart rate frequency reached (integer number between 60 and 202)
7) Exercise Angina: inducted angina due to excercise (Y/N)
8) Oldpeak ST: numerical value measured in slump
9) ST Slope: The slope of the ST segment of maximal exercise (Up: slope ascending, Flat: flat, Down: descending slope)
